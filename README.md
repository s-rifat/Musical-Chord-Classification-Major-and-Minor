# Musical Chord Classification: Major and Minor using ML and DL
<p align="justify" >
We have built our own dataset. We have recorded waveform audio files (.wav format) for the dataset.
Each audio file represents a chord played in a major or minor key. The dataset contains
extracted features using CENS, MFCCs, spectrogram etc. of 620 waveform audio
files where half of the audio files are in the major key and remaining files are in the
minor key. We have used different types of musical instruments such as electric guitar,
acoustic guitar, keyboard, as well as different types of presets for sound processing. We
have used different machine learning and deep learning algorithms for the classification such as Extra Tree
Classification, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Random
Forest Classification, DNN, LSTM etc. as well as different types of regressions to compare the outcomes.
The method works by taking an input audio, assigning importance to various
aspects in the audio, extracting the features and being able to differentiate one from
the other by analyzing the features and spectrogram data.
